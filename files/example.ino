/*
 - put comments at a different line
 - make sure the end of the loop has a delay statement
 - all ino files must be the same baud (maybe all 9600)
 - note that it is highly important to separate the numbers for the semicolon
 - you cannot use the print function outside of the main loop
 - pins must be defined outside of the loop and the setup
 - make sure your global variables are different between experiments
 - make sure you do not reuse functions in other ino files or the program will choose
 - make sure variables within the loop or setup are not the same between ino files or it will yield unexpected result
 - make sure the loop start is straight under its tag
 - make sure you mention the function name in a comment right below the declaration
 - every function must have the function tag
